      <h2>Understanding Housing Affordability in Seattle</h2>
      <p>
        Seattle is one of the fastest-growing cities in the United States, and rising housing
        costs have pushed many residents to spend a disproportionate share of their income on
        rent. This dashboard explores where those burdens are most concentrated, who is most
        affected, and how local zoning policy relates to affordability across the city.
      </p>
      <p>
        The primary metrics visualized are median apartment rent by census tract (2001–2025)
        and rent burden — the percentage of renter households spending more than 35% of their
        income on housing. An overlay of Mandatory Housing Affordability (MHA) zoning areas
        provides policy context.

      <h2>What We Set Out to Show</h2>
      <p>
        This project is not a policy analysis. It is an exploratory tool designed to make
        spatial patterns in housing cost visible in a way that tables and reports cannot.
        Some tracts have high rents but low burden because incomes are also high. Others are
        burdened despite relatively modest rents because the people who live there earn very
        little. Mapping both variables together reveals these nuances.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Mandatory Housing Affordability overlay allows users to explore how zoning policy
        is distributed across the city relative to where affordability pressures are greatest.
        The intended audience includes Seattle renters, housing advocates, urban planners,
        community organizations, and researchers studying housing inequality.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong style="color: var(--text-primary);">A note on potential negative impacts:</strong>
        Visualizing areas with high rent burden and low income could contribute to stigmatization
        or inform real estate speculation. We have mitigated this by focusing on aggregate
        tract-level trends rather than individual addresses, using neutral language throughout,
        and making clear this tool is intended for advocacy and awareness — not investment decisions.

        This project was developed as part of GEOG 458: Advanced Digital Geographies at the
        University of Washington, taught by
        <strong style="color: var(--text-primary);">Professor Bo Zhao</strong>.
        We thank our teaching assistants for their guidance and feedback throughout the quarter.

        All datasets are publicly available. The three source datasets were processed and
        merged into a single GeoJSON file at the census tract level using Python.
